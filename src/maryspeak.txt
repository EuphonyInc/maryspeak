OPTIONS
       -d --debug

       --host[=hostname]
              Sets the hostname for connection to a MaryTTS server. 
       
              If --hosts is used without the hostname set, localhost is assumed. If not set a 
              MaryTTS service is instantiated within the context of the command.
              
       -i --stdin
              Read text input from stdin instead of a file

              If neither -f nor --stdin, words are spoken, or if none then text is spoken from
              stdin, each line separately.

       -o --stdout
              Write speech output to stdout.

       --version
              Show version information.
